:::{note}
Model files are lazily downloaded the first time you run a metric function. For example, the first time you run the ``langcheck.metrics.sentiment()`` function, LangCheck will automatically download the Twitter-roBERTa-base model.

## Installation FAQ

Depending on your environment, you might need to install additional system libraries for `pip install langcheck` to work.

If you have any problems installing LangCheck, please check the FAQ below or [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/citadel-ai/langcheck/issues).

### 1. Installing LangCheck with Python 3.12

As of February 2024, one of LangCheck's Japanese dependencies, [`fugashi`](https://github.com/polm/fugashi), doesn't provide wheels for Python 3.12, so you'll need to first install MeCab for pip to successfully build `fugashi`.

**Installing MeCab on Linux (Debian/Ubuntu)**

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y mecab libmecab-dev mecab-ipadic-utf8
```

**Installing MeCab on macOS**

```bash
brew install mecab
```

**Installing MeCab on Windows**

We haven't tested LangCheck on Windows with Python 3.12, but it may work if you install MeCab with [the official installer](https://taku910.github.io/mecab/#install).

### 2. The error message `command 'gcc' failed`

As of February 2024, one of LangCheck's Japanese dependencies, [`dartsclone`](https://github.com/s-yata/darts-clone), doesn't provide wheels for Python 3.10+. You'll need to have `gcc` installed for pip to successfully build `dartsclone`.

Most systems already have `gcc` installed, with the exception of "slim" Docker images such as [`python:3.11-slim-buster`](https://hub.docker.com/_/python). If you're using this image, you can:

1. Use `python:3.11-buster` instead of `python:3.11-slim-buster`, which includes gcc.
1. Run `apt update && apt install build-essential -y` (e.g. in your Dockerfile) to install gcc.
