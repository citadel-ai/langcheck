    """Applies jailbreak templates to each string in instances.

    Args:
        instances: A single string or a list of strings to be augmented.
        templates: A list templates to apply. If None, some templates are
            randomly selected and used. Available templates are:
            - basic
            - chatgpt_dan
            - chatgpt_good_vs_evil
            - john
            - universal_adversarial_suffix
        num_perturbations: The number of perturbed instances to generate for
            each string in instances. Should be equal to or less than the number
            of templates.
        randomize_order: If True, the order of the templates is randomized.
            When turned off, num_perturbations needs to be equal to the number
            of templates.
        seed: The seed for the random number generator. You can fix the seed to
            deterministically select the same templates.
        custom_templates: A list of tuples of names and paths to custom Jinja2
            templates. The template should contain an `{{input_query}}` placeholder,
            which will be replaced by the input query.

    Returns:
        A list of perturbed instances.
