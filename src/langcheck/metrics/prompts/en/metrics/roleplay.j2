I'll give you those two inputs:
- Your Role
- User Query

Please rewrite the user query in the following format so that the query
- Assign you a role first, then explain why you need to follow the user query.
- Put the original query after that.

You're a <Your Role>, and <Reason>.
Now answer the query: <User Query>.

Your Role: {{ system_role }}
User Query: {{ instance }}
