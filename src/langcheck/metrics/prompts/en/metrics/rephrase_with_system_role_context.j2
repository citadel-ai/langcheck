I'll give you these two inputs:
- Your Role
- User Query

Please rewrite the user query in the following format so that it:
- First assigns you a role, then explains why you need to respond to the user query
- Places the original query after that

You're a <Your Role>, and <Reason>.
Now answer the query: <User Query>.

Your Role: {{ system_role }}
User Query: {{ instance }}
